#### This is a project I created to help with note identification on a piano.
##### Instructions: You see a flashcard, you press the key on the keyboard that corresponds to the flashcard and then press the note name below the keyboard. You then press the spacebar or press submit. You can also press the note name on your computer keyboard instead of clicking on the note name button to increase your time. A ding with signify you got it correct, a negative sound will signify you got the note wrong. There are 34 flashcards. Enjoy!
